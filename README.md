## Data Model

A share (file or text) has the following structure:

```typescript
type Share = {
  id: string;
  type: 'file' | 'text';
  title?: string;
  name?: string; // file name or text title
  fileType?: string; // for files
  content?: string; // for texts
  code: string; // 6-digit sharing code
  accessCode?: string; // alternative code
  createdAt: string;
  expiry?: string; // ISO date string or 'never'
  expiresAt?: string; // ISO date string (preferred for expiry)
  passwordHash?: string; // if password protected
  storagePath?: string; // for files
  userId: string;
  status: 'ACTIVE' | 'REQUEST' | 'REFUSED';
  // ...other fields as needed
};
```

## Application Logic

- **Authentication:** Uses Supabase Auth for secure login, registration, and session management.
- **Sharing:** When a user shares a file or text, a unique 6-digit code is generated and stored with the share in the Supabase database.
- **Expiry:** Users can select expiry for each share. "Never Expire" is the default and is always available in the dropdown.
- **Editing:** When editing, the form is prefilled with the existing share data.
- **Listing:** Shares are listed in a table (desktop) or cards (mobile), showing all relevant details.
- **Details Modal:** Clicking a row/card opens a modal with all share details.
- **Delete:** Users can delete any share with confirmation. Files are automatically deleted from storage.
- **Password Protection:** Shares can be protected with a password, which is hashed before storing.
- **Real-time Updates:** Shares update in real-time using Supabase subscriptions.
